# GATT
Hi Everyone!
welcome to my GATT Application:)
this application perform data extraction using Screen Scraping from the
Wikipedia Intuit article.
The application will extract data, process it, output it and may perform some additional actions.
In places where you’re required to output href links, the text that’s referred to is the text of the
link itself and nothing else.

Set up the environment!
1.Java 8: even though Java 11 is the most recent version with Long-Term Support (LTS), Java 8 remains the preferred production standard among developers.
2.Gradle: is a flexible open-source build automation tool with a wide range of features, including dependency management (requires Java 8 or higher);
3.HtmlUnit: can simulate browser events such as clicking and submitting forms when scraping and has JavaScript support.
4.Jsoup:  is an open source Java library used mainly for extracting data from HTML. It also allows you to manipulate and output HTML. It has a steady development line, great documentation, and a fluent and flexible API.
